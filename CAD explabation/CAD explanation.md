# Process
### The process of creating the robot was quite weird. At first I started from the body so I can shape the arms around the body, but then I realized that the body needs to be changed, so I worked from the arms to the body. Also there were some components I could not find online so I had to cad them myself which took quite some time.

## Body
### The process of the body was to make one big rectangle with two stubs out for the arms to connect to and the inside had to be hollow so that I could fit the arduino components.
### Once I made that I really did not have to modify the body.
### But then one day I had realized that I made the body with only half the requirements, the body did not allow the arms to go vertically up.
### So I had to fix the body to make it with two circle stubs instead of one rectangle stub.
### Luckly, I found all the electrical parts online.

## Arms
### The arms were more complicated then the body, I had to make more then the arms for the arms to work.
### First off, the arms I simpily used a rectangle that had been shelled, and I used a sickle kind of shape with two rectangle cut outs so that it can rotate without getting stuck.
### Using this it allowed me to easily connect the hinges to both parts.
### But to make the arms work I needed a servo motor, but unluckly there were no servo motors online that I could use. So I had to make my own servo motor.
### This took me a couple days because I could not figure out how to make ridges. But then I realized that I does not matter because I am going to have that covered with the top attachment.
### So I just added a wire to the top so that it could pull the arm parts.

# Reasonin behin designs
### The design of the robot was carfully thought of and chosen.

## Body
### In the body the main design that needs to be talked about are the circle stubs.
### These were added because the arms need to rotate 90 degrees up and down so a circle is the best option.

## Arms
### The top part of the hand looks like a sickle, this is because we need something sharp that can pierce rock.
### The part below it is a rectangle because it easily connects with the hinges
### The hinges allows for 90 degree rotation in the direction in which is needed.
### The servo motor are suppost to pull and push the arms 90 degrees up and down.
