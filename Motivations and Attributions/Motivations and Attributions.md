# How I got the idea
### Well this all started on an average school day, when me and my brother got bored and decided to go out side to play vollyball and to think of ideas. While thinking he came up with the idea of making robots to traverse nature. Before this I was completely stuck on what I should do. But this day, he gave me new ideas. 
### Now with the idea of traversing nature, I got thinking. What is something that someone would want to traverse, but it would be too dangerous or flat out impossible to traverse. 
### Thats when I thought of the idea to make a robot to navigate caves. 
### At first, I was thinking of making a car because they are really good for moving around, but I also realized that they can only go horizontally, not verticaly.
### So, thats when I thought of making human like arms to grab or pierce the rock and pull to move around.

# The impacts on the people
### First off, let me tell you about a story of a man who once tried to traverse a very tight and narrow cave. This accident is from the nutty putty cave. This cave is insanely narrow, but just barely big enough for a human to fit in. But there was one unexplored part of the cave, he didn't have a map and went into this part of the cave. This cannal that he went into was way too tight, but he kept pushing. But then he sealed his own grave, he went head first down into a part of the cave that looked like it would continue, but it didn't. He has trapped and could not get out, rescuers tried pulling him out with a pully mechanism, but he fell back down. A little later he died.
### Now, he died because of his curiosity, if he wasn't as curious he would not have even entered the cave.
### So this robot will fufill peoples curiosity and could save peoples lives because they don't have to explore the cave themselves.
### This cave can also help any situation where imaging of a small cave/crack is required, for example to find a bomb or to find a child, or maybe to even find an exit to a cave that you might be stuck in.
### What ever it is, this robot can help.

# Why this field
### The reason I chose to impact nature instead of impacting humans was because I myself am curious of what lies in caves and because this robot could save lives.
### Most caves can't be explored because they are too small and too dangerous to traverse, but there might be new organisms living down there that have not been found.
### So this robot can allow for those caves to be explored.
### Additionally I am afraid of exploring caves, especially tight caves. So I wanted to make a robot that could do that for me, but instead of ones humans can fit in. I would rather explore impossible to explore caves that are too small for humans.
### Also because humans can be dumb, they will go trying to explore these tight caves out of curiousy, and then they will get stuck. So instead of creating another nutty putty cave incident, why not just let people explore these caves without them trying to fit themselves inside of them.

# Why caves
### The main reason I chose caves instead of climbing trees for instance is because I want to explore something that humans can't normally explore.
### Since caves that are really are unable to be explored they seemed like the perfect option for me.

# Future Improvements 
### To be honest I am not sure if a DC motor to control the circles is the best choice, this is mainly because of the speed of the DC motor, and the fact that I can't have the arm move more then 90 degrees in both direction which is why a servo motor might have been a better pick.
### Additionally, for a DC motor to move in both directions it must have the polarity reversed and unreversed, to do this you either need a module or two relays.
### Also, a DC motor can't have its position reset which makes that arms be in any direction and won't be straight when the robot is started up.
### Straying away from the dc motor, I think I could have made it where the hinge attachs to the sickle a bit more flat, because right now the hinge is barely on the sickle.

# Unique applications
### The cave diving robot doesn't have to always be used for caves, since it is ment to pierce stuff and pull it can be used in many different small spaces, ridged or smooth.
### For example if there is a kid stuck behind this small gap that no adult or human can fit through, you could use this robot to contact and confirm is he/she is fine. It could also deliver supplies to the kid.
### Maybe you are stuck inside a cave and see a small opening that you can't get through. You could use the robot to see if the crack leads to the outside or you could use it to signal someone to come help you.
### You could also use this robot to find infestations below your house.
