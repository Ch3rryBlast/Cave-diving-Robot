# Cave-diving-Robot
## This robot was designed by Charan Thoka. The robot's purpose is to traverse small, tight, and narrow caves that humans can't explore. This robot can fufill one's curiosity while keeping them safe from the dangers of super small spaces. This inovative robot was designed with four different arms to help with verticle and horizontal movement. The robot is able to go through more areas then a simple car because this robot can go upwards. This cave diving robot also comes with two different cameras to help navigate forwards and backwards. Finally the robot comes with its own arduino that programable so this robot can be customizezed to your liking. 

## To use this robot is not easy, it takes time and training to fully master the movement. Once mastered you will be able to manuver around tight caves with hopefully ease.

# Safety
## 1. This robot requires batteries and contains electronic equipment, when use take precaution and never but the appliance in water or any liquid.
## 2. Close supervision may be necessary when using this robot with children.
## 3. When the robot is not in action or being used please remove the battery for safty.
## 4. Avoid contact with moving parts, contact with such parts may cause damage to the user and the robot.
## 5. When using this robot be careful, there are hanging plastic wires that one may trip on.
## 6. Enter caves at your own risk.
## 7. When using this robot, as a fail safe it may be beneficial to attach the robot to a string, so that if necessary you can pull the robot back.

# How to use
### The robot has multiple componets that are all controlled by joysticks such as the arms.
### This robot will wirelessly send signals to the arduino uno, so that the joystick and be used without a wire. 
### There are going to be two different websites that you must keep track of, both of these are IP adresses. These are for both front and back cameras.
### There will be one joystick per arm and there will be one joystick for the up and down movement of all four arms.
### For joystick1 (Vertical movement) move the joystick up for arm 1 (Top left), down for arm 2 (Top right), left for arm 3 (bottom left), and right for arm 4 (top left)
### For all arms, moving the joystick up and down will control the first joint, and side to side will control the second joint.
### Each joystick will be labeled from 0-4. 0 being vertical and 1-4 being each arm.

# Disassembly
### the top of the robot is screwed in so to remove the top to access the arduino/electronic components you must unscrew the top part. If you want to remove or replace anyone of the join just simply unscrew the screws on each hinge.
